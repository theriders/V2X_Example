abstract = {We investigated the electronic properties of pentacene-based organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) incorporated with an organic dielectric layer (ODL) fabricated using a homemade, cold plasma–enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Ar-carried trimethylaluminum monomer was introduced into an evaporator mixer controlled at 130°C, and an ODL was deposited on Si- or indium tin oxide (ITO)–coated plastic substrate under N2 plasma. High radio frequency power (100W)-deposited ODL (dielectric constant κ=1.6) supported the fabrication of pentacene-based OTFT on Si substrate at low voltages (<1.5V). The decreased deposition time (10min) reduced the film thickness of the ODL (95nm), thereby increasing its dielectric constant to 3.3. We also deposited ODL on ITO–coated plastic substrate to fabricate a flexible OTFT with a mobility of 2.1cm2/Vs and an on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 103.}
